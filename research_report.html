<h2>Flux: Conquering the Hand-y Challenge of Image Generation</h2>

<p>
    <a href="[hypothetical link to post]">Flux</a>, a new diffusion model, is generating excitement (and stunning images!) within the LocalLLama community. What's got everyone talking? Its remarkable ability to create realistic hands â€“ a notoriously difficult feat for AI image generators. This open-source model's climb to the top of Hugging Face rankings speaks volumes about its potential for local deployment and experimentation. Could this be the end of uncanny valley hands in AI-generated art?
