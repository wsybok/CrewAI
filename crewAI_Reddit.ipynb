I remember listening to [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Cx0qTY0ZBUK8VFfMnh2CU?si=4LeYacPuT6a6ZrFqe-TbGA&t=1434&pi=2lPYcGrXR2Wt5) where Rush, the author of this paper, said that while trying knowledge distillation on translation models, token level distillation wasn\\'t enough, as there\\'s some \"localization\" in distilling at the token level. Hence, distilling at the sequence level should be more optimal in capturing the distribution of a sequence of text. So I think it can still be called distillation. I also think that it\\'s common for people to do distillation by combining these 2, aka training the model on the synthetic data and add to the cost function the distillation loss.\\n\\nI also have some fun thing to discuss and would love to hear what you think about it. So if we view this from the probabilistic perspective, these distillation methods might help mitigate hallucinations. One hot encoding (OHE) distributions, whose entropy are zero and hence carry lots of assumptions that might not exist in the data (principle of maximum entropy). And these assumptions cause hallucinations. Hence, training a model on cross entropy with these OHE will force the model to hallucinate. So knowledge distillation solves this by replacing OHEs with the soft labels, optimizing the model\\'s prediction to targets of fewer assumptions.', 'The problem is that colloquially distillation covers two things\\n\\n1. the technical teacher-student distillation\\n\\n2. any learning from a more powerful model via synthetic data\\n\\nBoth are popular today, the first is the second definition, the second is what Zuck meant.', 'Yeah. It makes sense because 8B is not performant as it supposed to be, atleast in my tests.', 'In my experience (a PhD at Stanford), \"distilation\" is a word often used for both things . I\\'m not even sure it\\'s technically wrong to use that word when training on hard labeled outputs. Though it wouldn\\'t have been that hard for them to save maybe the top 5 logits for every word predicted. Then at training time, they could have scattered the remaining probability among the rest of the tokens. That\\'d be an inexpensive, yet good approximation to what you\\'re asking for.\\n\\nAlso, in my experience, using soft labels in your distillation is less important when you have tons of data.']}, {'title': 'Why GPT-4o mini beats Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LMSys', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ed01p8/why_gpt4o_mini_beats_claude_35_sonnet_on_lmsys/', 'comments': ['The refusal explanation makes a lot of sense.

The arena rankings are accurate.', 'in my experience Claude obeys and thinks, but is not factually correct, sometimes silly. 4o is more factual, it kinda \"rather will answer another question\" than lie. 4o makes syntax errors in PowerShell and needs special prompting to not use bizzare syntax that does not work.

I remember listening to [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Cx0qTY0ZBUK8VFfMnh2CU?si=4LeYacPuT6a6ZrFqe-TbGA&t=1434&pi=2lPYcGrXR2Wt5) where Rush, the author of this paper, said that while trying knowledge distillation on translation models, token level distillation wasn\\'t enough, as there\\'s some \"localization\" in distilling at the token level. Hence, distilling at the sequence level should be more optimal in capturing the distribution of a sequence of text. So I think it can still be called distillation. I also think that it\\'s common for people to do distillation by combining these 2, aka training the model on the synthetic data and add to the cost function the distillation loss.\\n\\nI also have some fun thing to discuss and would love to hear what you think about it. So if we view this from the probabilistic perspective, these distillation methods might help mitigate hallucinations. One hot encoding (OHE) distributions, whose entropy are zero and hence carry lots of assumptions that might not exist in the data (principle of maximum entropy). And these assumptions cause hallucinations. Hence, training a model on cross entropy with these OHE will force the model to hallucinate. So knowledge distillation solves this by replacing OHEs with the soft labels, optimizing the model\\'s prediction to targets of fewer assumptions.', 'The problem is that colloquially distillation covers two things\\n\\n1. the technical teacher-student distillation\\n\\n2. any learning from a more powerful model via synthetic data\\n\\nBoth are popular today, the first is the second definition, the second is what Zuck meant.', 'Yeah. It makes sense because 8B is not performant as it supposed to be, atleast in my tests.', 'In my experience (a PhD at Stanford), \"distilation\" is a word often used for both things . I\\'m not even sure it\\'s technically wrong to use that word when training on hard labeled outputs. Though it wouldn\\'t have been that hard for them to save maybe the top 5 logits for every word predicted. Then at training time, they could have scattered the remaining probability among the rest of the tokens. That\\'d be an inexpensive, yet good approximation to what you\\'re asking for.\\n\\nAlso, in my experience, using soft labels in your distillation is less important when you have tons of data.']}, {'title': 'Why GPT-4o mini beats Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LMSys', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ed01p8/why_gpt4o_mini_beats_claude_35_sonnet_on_lmsys/', 'comments': ['The refusal explanation makes a lot of sense.

            "\n",
            "### Technical Insights on the New ROPE Scaling Algorithm in Llama 3.1 and Its Implications\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **ROPE Scaling Algorithm Performance**:\n",
            "    - **Benchmarks**: Users have reported that until the new ROPE scaling algorithm is fully implemented, results from `llama.cpp` and `exllamav2` inference are similar or slightly inferior to Llama 3.1. Benchmarks suggest impressive performance, especially in long-context answers.\n",
            "    - **Long-Context Answers**: A user tested the Llama-3.1-70b model by providing multiple chapters of a novel and then asking it to list all characters in order of appearance. The user was very impressed, stating it delivered the best long-context answers to date, surpassing previous models like Nous-Capybara-34b.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Quantization Issues**:\n",
            "    - **Faulty Quants**: Some initial issues with quantization were reported, particularly with the Llama 3.1 8B model tested with Q6_K, which seemed to perform poorly, appearing \"stupid\" to the user.\n",
            "    - **Coherence in Large Contexts**: Another issue highlighted was the loss of coherence in large contexts (e.g., ~24k tokens). It suggests that there may be differences in how ROPE is handled, which might be contributing to this problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Community Solutions and Workarounds**:\n",
            "    - **Colab and Kaggle Notebooks**: A community member created a free Colab notebook to finetune Llama 3.1 8B, making the process 2.1x faster and using 60% less VRAM. Similarly, a Kaggle notebook was shared for free GPU compute time.\n",
            "    - **Frequency Adjustments**: Until the ROPE scaling is fixed in GGUF for Llama-3.1 models, a user suggested using specific frequency adjustments, which have been tested up to 80K tokens and reported to work on the jailbroken Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inferences from Large Models**:\n",
            "    - **High VRAM Usage**: Testing the Llama-3.1-70b involved significant VRAM usage (78GB with 4x3090 setup). This highlights the model's demand for high-end hardware for optimal performance.\n",
            "    - **Quantization Settings**: Different quantization settings and their impacts on performance were discussed. For example, using settings like 64000 tokens window, auto-split, and no cache quantization.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Performance Comparisons**:\n",
            "    - **Comparison with Other Models**: Users compared Llama 3.1 models with other leading models like NeMo 12b and GPT-4o. Some users found Llama 3.1 models to be impressive, especially in specific use cases like long-context answers, while others noted issues with early quantization implementations.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Implications\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Research and Development**:\n",
            "    - The community's active engagement in testing and providing feedback is crucial for refining the ROPE scaling algorithm. Continued collaboration will help address quantization and coherence issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Practical Applications**:\n",
            "    - The ability to handle long-context answers effectively opens up new possibilities for applications in fields like literature analysis, legal document review, and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Hardware Requirements**:\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **ROPE Scaling Algorithm Performance**:\n",
            "    - **Benchmarks**: Users have reported that until the new ROPE scaling algorithm is fully implemented, results from `llama.cpp` and `exllamav2` inference are similar or slightly inferior to Llama 3.1. Benchmarks suggest impressive performance, especially in long-context answers.\n",
            "    - **Long-Context Answers**: A user tested the Llama-3.1-70b model by providing multiple chapters of a novel and then asking it to list all characters in order of appearance. The user was very impressed, stating it delivered the best long-context answers to date, surpassing previous models like Nous-Capybara-34b.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Quantization Issues**:\n",
            "    - **Faulty Quants**: Some initial issues with quantization were reported, particularly with the Llama 3.1 8B model tested with Q6_K, which seemed to perform poorly, appearing \"stupid\" to the user.\n",
            "    - **Coherence in Large Contexts**: Another issue highlighted was the loss of coherence in large contexts (e.g., ~24k tokens). It suggests that there may be differences in how ROPE is handled, which might be contributing to this problem.\n",

            "    - **High VRAM Usage**: Testing the Llama-3.1-70b involved significant VRAM usage (78GB with 4x3090 setup). This highlights the model's demand for high-end hardware for optimal performance.\n",
            "    - **Quantization Settings**: Different quantization settings and their impacts on performance were discussed. For example, using settings like 64000 tokens window, auto-split, and no cache quantization.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Performance Comparisons**:\n",
            "    - **Comparison with Other Models**: Users compared Llama 3.1 models with other leading models like NeMo 12b and GPT-4o.

I remember listening to [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Cx0qTY0ZBUK8VFfMnh2CU?si=4LeYacPuT6a6ZrFqe-TbGA&t=1434&pi=2lPYcGrXR2Wt5) where Rush, the author of this paper, said that while trying knowledge distillation on translation models, token level distillation wasn\\'t enough, as there\\'s some \"localization\" in distilling at the token level. Hence, distilling at the sequence level should be more optimal in capturing the distribution of a sequence of text. So I think it can still be called distillation. I also think that it\\'s common for people to do distillation by combining these 2, aka training the model on the synthetic data and add to the cost function the distillation loss.\\n\\nI also have some fun thing to discuss and would love to hear what you think about it. So if we view this from the probabilistic perspective, these distillation methods might help mitigate hallucinations. One hot encoding (OHE) distributions, whose entropy are zero and hence carry lots of assumptions that might not exist in the data (principle of maximum entropy). And these assumptions cause hallucinations. Hence, training a model on cross entropy with these OHE will force the model to hallucinate. So knowledge distillation solves this by replacing OHEs with the soft labels, optimizing the model\\'s prediction to targets of fewer assumptions.', 'The problem is that colloquially distillation covers two things\\n\\n1. the technical teacher-student distillation\\n\\n2. any learning from a more powerful model via synthetic data\\n\\nBoth are popular today, the first is the second definition, the second is what Zuck meant.', 'Yeah. It makes sense because 8B is not performant as it supposed to be, atleast in my tests.', 'In my experience (a PhD at Stanford), \"distilation\" is a word often used for both things . I\\'m not even sure it\\'s technically wrong to use that word when training on hard labeled outputs. Though it wouldn\\'t have been that hard for them to save maybe the top 5 logits for every word predicted. Then at training time, they could have scattered the remaining probability among the rest of the tokens. That\\'d be an inexpensive, yet good approximation to what you\\'re asking for.\\n\\nAlso, in my experience, using soft labels in your distillation is less important when you have tons of data.']}, {'title': 'Why GPT-4o mini beats Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LMSys', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ed01p8/why_gpt4o_mini_beats_claude_35_sonnet_on_lmsys/', 'comments': ['The refusal explanation makes a lot of sense.
